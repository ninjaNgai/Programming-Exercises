  <b>What is HackerEarth?</b><br>
    <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com">HackerEarth</a> is another coding platform that provides programming challenges in a wide variety of languages, on a wide variety of subjects. For programming practice, these include data structures and algorithms, machine learning, and math. The site also hosts occasional competitive programming contests. <br><br>
  <b>What's this repository for?</b><br>
      A collection of my solutions to the tracks I've completed, mostly in Java. Many existing public solutions to these challenges are overly complex, overly brief, or both (!), leading readers to some poor habits. Mine prioritize readability, efficiency, and general best practices. <br><br>
